Project Overview
This project is a Java-based Course Selection and Management System for KMV.
It includes two main portals:

Admin Portal: Admins can manage courses, students, and lecturers, assign courses, and oversee academic records.

Lecturer Portal: Lecturers can view assigned courses, manage student lists, mark attendance, and update grades.

All features are implemented in a modern GUI (Java Swing) and use an embedded Derby database for secure, persistent data.

How to Run
Open the project in NetBeans 23 and run the main class.

The embedded Derby database sets up automatically—no manual DB service needed.

Test credentials for marking/demo:

Admin: Username: A101 – Password: admin01rk

Lecturer: Username: KMV001 – Password: pass1

Other admin and lecturer accounts are available and functional.
